/**
 * @defgroup History History module
 * @ingroup Eflete
 *
 * This module provides access to the functionality of the control changes.
 * Support for changes in the attributes of individual parts, the creation and
 * Remove the part states, and create history of changes in parts (create /
 * delete / move in the stack).
 *
 * History of changes assigned to individual modules, it allows to store
 * several stories for the various modules.
 * <pre>
 *  -----------   -----------   -----------        -----------
 *  |         |   | change1 |   | change2 |        | changeN |
 *  | Module1 |-> | (attr)  |-> | (part)  | ->..-> | (state) |

 * </pre>
 * The new changes registered in History module using @c history_change_add.
 *
 * All changes to one module register in general stack of events which is,
 * organized within @c Module.
 *
 * Manager of the stack of modules ensures that for each type of change was
 * caused by the corresponding functional. Manager parses the new changes by
 * source type, and then transmits the data on changes in specific submodule
 * (@c Ñ€istory_part, @c history_state, @c history_attribute ), where the
 * structuring of the data according to their content.
 *
 * Move to change history is organized with the help of @c undo and @c redo.
 * When you rollback changes with @c undo, history of the canceled changes
 * still stored in module history. Just moves the pointer to the current event
 * in history. In a situation where a pointer to the current change does not
 * indicate the end of the list and there is a request to save the new changes
 * @c history_change_add, all changes, that stored after the current will be
 * lost. And the new change will be added immediately after the current one.
 * A pointer to the current change moves to new change.
 *
 * As an example, it added three different types of changes in the module history.
 * History of changes is as follows:
 * '*' - The current change.
 *
 * <pre>                                  *
 *  -----------   -----------    -----------
 * | change1 |   | change2 |    | change3 |
 * | (attr)  |-> | (part)  | -> | (state) |
 * -----------   -----------    -----------
 * </pre>
 * When changes is canceled with @c undo, history will look like this:
 *
 * <pre>                  *
 * -----------   -----------    -----------
 * | change1 |   | change2 |    | change3 |
 * | (attr)  |-> | (part)  | -> | (state) |
 * -----------   -----------    -----------
 * </pre>
 * Now add a new change to the type of N4 attr:
 *
 * <pre>                              [deleted]      *
 * -----------   -----------    -----------   -----------
 * | change1 |   | change2 |    | change3 |   | change4 |
 * | (attr)  |-> | (part)  |    | (state) |   | (attr)  |
 * -----------   -----------    -----------   -----------
 *                  |                              /\
 *                  |------------------------------|
 * </pre>
 * The diagram illustrates the case when 3rd update is lost and rollback of
 * this change is impossible.
