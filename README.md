EFL Edje Theme Editor is a rich graphical tool for Enlightenment Foundation Library ([EFL](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-efl)) that provides UI for edc markup. It is aimed at simplifying the creation and editing of widget styles. In addition, this is a great example of a full-fledged practical use of the amazing functionality of the EFL.

An EDC (Edje data collection) file is a text file that contains the code describing the position, size, and other parameters of graphical elements that compose the visual aspect of your EFL application. In addition to graphical elements, it can also handle sounds. EDC is a description language where the objects of an interface are described using a text description. An EDC file needs to be compiled into a `.edj` file using the Edje library tools. After compiling, the `.edj` file can be used as a theme file by a native EFL-based application.

No one, for sure, wants to learn EDC syntax. Eflete was designed with the idea that its target users are not just programmers but also designers. Besides styles, Eflete is also able to create and edit custom layouts. This is a useful feature for developers who create application layouts.

## Requirements

   * EFL â‰¥ 1.23.3

<!-- ([git](https://git.enlightenment.org/enlightenment/efl)) -->

## Compiling

Once you have met the requirements, compiling and installing is simple:
:

```sh
meson . build
ninja -C build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

Normal compilation is in `/usr/local`. You will want to ensure the default prefix `/usr/local` is available to build tools. If you know what you are doing, you can change the prefix, but this assumes you do not and the above prefix is used. These environment variables are used during the build, so you may want to make them more permanent.
```sh
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:"$PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:"$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

Compilation options are (see `meson_options.txt` as well):

| Option           | Default value |
| :----------------|:-------------:|
| -Denable-nls     | true          |
| -Denable-audio   | true          |
| -Denable-enventor| false         |
| -Denable-tizen   | false         |
| -Dbuild-doc      | false         |
| -Denable-debug   | false         |
| -Denable-todo    | false         |
| -Dbuild-tests    | false         |

You can see your current setup in the meson setup output.

To run tests:
```sh
meson --reconfigure -Dbuild-tests=true . build 
ninja -C build test
```
## Applying themes

To apply a theme to elementary, you should place created edj-file in the elementary themes directory (default: `/usr/local/share/elementary/themes`). Note: do not forget to add read permissions to the copied file. After that, the theme will be available for selection from `elementary_config`.

## Bash autocompletion

To enable bash autocompletion for eflete, copy `eflete_autocompletion.sh` file (you can find it in `scripts` folder) to your
bash completion directory or add the following line to your ~/.bashrc:
`source /YOUR/PATH/eflete_autocompletion.sh`

## Translations
You can help translate Eflete into your language. Eflete is using
[Weblate](https://weblate.org/) for translation management.

Go to the [Eflete localization project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/eflete/eflete/)
to start translating. If the language you want to translate into is not already
available, you [can add it here](https://hosted.weblate.org/new-lang/eflete/eflete/).
